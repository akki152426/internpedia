        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hello! I’m an aspiring Electrical and Electronics Engineer currently in my 4th year at RYMEC, Bellary. My journey in engineering has been both challenging and fulfilling, blending theoretical knowledge with practical applications. Through my studies, I've developed a strong foundation in core electrical and electronics concepts, with hands-on experience in everything from circuit analysis to embedded systems.
            One of my proudest projects involved RFID technology, where I gained insights into real-world applications of electronics in automation and security. Working on this project not only enhanced my technical skills but also honed my problem-solving abilities and taught me how to think critically under time constraints. It was a rewarding experience that reinforced my passion for innovation and practical engineering.
            Alongside my core subjects, I’ve ventured into web development, learning HTML, CSS, and C. These skills have broadened my technical toolkit and allowed me to explore diverse areas within tech. Additionally, I’ve acquired CAD skills, which are essential for precise design and visualization in engineering.
            I’m always eager to expand my knowledge, learn from new challenges, and apply my skills in meaningful ways. I’m enthusiastic about working on projects that bridge my interests in electronics, programming, and design to create impactful solutions.</p>

            <h3>RFID-Based Automatic Door Lock Access Control System Using Arduino Uno</h3>
            <p>In this project, I developed a secure and automated door lock access control system utilizing RFID technology and an Arduino Uno. The primary goal was to enhance security by allowing only authorized users to access a secured area through RFID tags. The system was designed to be user-friendly and efficient, providing seamless operation with quick tag recognition and response.
                I programmed the Arduino Uno to manage both tag identification and door control. When an authorized RFID tag is scanned, the system triggers a servo motor to unlock the door, allowing access. Unauthorized tags are denied entry, ensuring secure access control. Integrating components like servo motors and RFID readers required a deep understanding of both hardware and software, and this project allowed me to refine my skills in embedded systems and microcontroller programming.
                This experience not only strengthened my technical capabilities but also demonstrated the potential of RFID technology in real-world applications like security and automation.</p>
